# Adobe-URL-Block-List
This is the Adobe URL/IP block list for your Host file,
The location of the host file is C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
Make sure you run your text editor as *'Administrator'*, otherwise you'll not be able to save the file,
Copy and paste the full list into your host file and save it.

If you have any extra URLs/IPs, give me a shout, and I'll add them to the list.


You may need to check your settings to show hidden files, Once there, then overwrite with the host file or add the full list to your host file.

If you have any other issues, please open an issue, and I'll reply as soon as possible.


## Update: I've now replaced the localhost IP 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0
